# Introductory
  Before starting with the showcase, I would like to mention that this build is not fully finish to my standards due to time crunch and being a beginner coder. I did not get to add a sound system to this fire alarm like I wanted, but I did manage to create an on and off kill switch to this alarm system code. I got this alarm code by James Bruce, where it detects movement, then scare the heck out of an intruder with a high pitched alarm sounds and flashing lights, but I changed this code by adding an on and off kill switch to the system because the code lacked a power button. The setbacks of this code was that there was no on and off switch for the alarm. It just triggeres the alarm on anybody who comes in the range of the arduino.
